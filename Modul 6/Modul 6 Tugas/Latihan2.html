    <h1>PTIK FKIP UNS</h1>
    <p id="teks">
        The Faculty of Teacher Training and Education, Sebelas Maret University, Surakarta is an Educational Personnel
        Education Institution (LPTK) which has 24 study programs in 6 majors. Each study program has its own
        characteristics in producing superior, strong and intelligent educational staff.<br><br>
        The Informatics and Computer Technology Education (PTIK) study program is planned to take shelter in the
        management of the Engineering and Vocational Education (PTK) department. This placement revises our previous
        statement, where the PTIK study program is under the P.MIPA department. PTIK is a study program that will
        produce graduates who are prioritized to teach in vocational/vocational programs. So, it would be better if PTIK
        was under the PTK department which oversees vocational programs such as Building Engineering Education, and
        Mechanical Engineering Education. To meet the needs of lecturers in the field of information technology that
        cannot be met by the PTK department, PTIK will conduct resource sharing with the mathematics study program.
